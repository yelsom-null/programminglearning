# INTERACTIVE PROGRAMMING LEARNING PLATFORM - UNIT 1 PLAN

## OVERVIEW
This document outlines the development plan for Unit 1: Introduction to Programming
for our interactive learning platform. The key differentiator of our platform is 
real-time visualization of code execution, allowing learners to immediately see 
the effects of their code as they write it.

## CORE PRINCIPLES
- Real-time visualization of variables, data, and execution flow
- Learn-by-doing with instant feedback
- Progressive complexity with scaffolded examples
- Clear, beginner-friendly explanations alongside visualizations

## UNIT 1: INTRODUCTION TO PROGRAMMING (2 WEEKS)

### LESSON 1: WHAT IS PROGRAMMING?
**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand what programming is at a conceptual level
- Learn how computers execute instructions sequentially
- Write first lines of code and see them execute

**Interactive Elements:**
1. Simple command sequence visualization
   - Example: `print("Hello")` → shows text appearing on screen
   - Example: `moveForward()` → shows character moving on grid

**Visualization Features:**
- Step-by-step execution highlighting
- Visual representation of each command's effect
- "Slow motion" execution option

### LESSON 2: VARIABLES AND DATA TYPES
**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand what variables are and how they store data
- Learn common data types (numbers, strings, booleans)
- Declare and use variables in simple programs

**Interactive Elements:**
1. Variable declaration and assignment
   ```javascript
   let age = 25;
   let name = "Alex";
   let isStudent = true;
   ```

2. Variable modification
   ```javascript
   age = age + 1;
   name = "Alex Smith";
   ```

**Visualization Features:**
- Memory boxes showing variable names and their current values
- Color-coding for different data types
- Visual indication when values change (animation/highlighting)
- Type badges showing what kind of data is stored

**Exercise Examples:**
1. "Create variables for a person's profile (name, age, occupation)"
2. "Change the values to represent a different person"
3. "Create variables to track game stats (score, lives, level)"

### LESSON 3: BASIC OPERATIONS AND EXPRESSIONS
**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, %)
- Learn about operator precedence
- Combine operations into expressions

**Interactive Elements:**
1. Arithmetic operations
   ```javascript
   let x = 5;
   let y = 3;
   let sum = x + y;        // 8
   let difference = x - y;  // 2
   let product = x * y;     // 15
   let quotient = x / y;    // 1.6666...
   let remainder = x % y;   // 2
   ```

2. Expression evaluation
   ```javascript
   let result = 2 + 3 * 4;  // 14, not 20
   let result2 = (2 + 3) * 4;  // 20
   ```

**Visualization Features:**
- Step-by-step evaluation of expressions
- Highlighting sub-expressions as they're calculated
- Visual representation of operator precedence (e.g., parentheses)
- "Calculation path" showing how the final result is derived

**Exercise Examples:**
1. "Calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle"
2. "Convert temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit"
3. "Calculate average of three test scores"

### LESSON 4: INPUT AND OUTPUT
**Learning Objectives:**
- Get input from the user
- Display output to the user
- Process and transform user input

**Interactive Elements:**
1. Basic I/O
   ```javascript
   // Simulated input
   let name = prompt("Enter your name:");
   console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
   ```

2. Input processing
   ```javascript
   let ageInput = prompt("Enter your age:");
   let age = parseInt(ageInput);
   let nextYear = age + 1;
   console.log("Next year you will be " + nextYear);
   ```

**Visualization Features:**
- Input boxes showing where data comes from
- Transformation of input (e.g., string → number)
- Flow of data from input → processing → output
- Console output area

**Exercise Examples:**
1. "Create a greeting program that asks for name and favorite color"
2. "Build a simple calculator that takes two numbers and shows their sum"
3. "Make a tip calculator for restaurant bills"

## UNIT 1 MINI-PROJECT: PERSONAL INFO CARD
**Objective:** Create a program that collects information from a user and displays a formatted "profile card"

**Requirements:**
1. Collect name, age, location, and hobby
2. Calculate birth year based on current year and age
3. Format all information into a profile display
4. Include at least one calculation

**Visualization Focus:**
- Variable tracking for all user inputs
- Transformation of data (calculation of birth year)
- String concatenation for display

## TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
