# Interactive Features for JavaScript Learning

This document outlines the new interactive and gamification features added to enhance student engagement in the learning platform.

## Progress Tracking

The progress tracking system consists of:

1. **Progress Service** - A local storage-based service that tracks:
   - Completed concepts per lesson
   - Points earned
   - Daily learning streak
   - Badges earned

2. **TeachingConcept Component** - Enhanced with:
   - Checkmarks for completed concepts
   - Collapsible sections
   - "Mark as Completed" button to track progress
   - Green highlighting for completed concepts

3. **UserProgressBar Component** - Displays:
   - Lesson completion percentage
   - Points accumulated
   - Learning streak
   - Badges earned

## Interactive Diagrams

The `InteractiveMemoryDiagram` component provides:

1. **Visual Memory Representation** - Shows:
   - Variable names
   - Memory addresses (simulated)
   - Value types with color-coding
   - Actual variable values

2. **Dynamic Updates** - Changes when:
   - Code samples are modified
   - New variables are added
   - Values are changed

3. **Integration with Lessons** - Used in:
   - Variables lesson
   - Data types lesson
   - Memory management concepts

## Gamification Elements

The platform integrates gamification through:

1. **Points System**
   - 5 points for completing each concept
   - 25 points for earning badges
   - Points displayed in the progress bar

2. **Badges**
   - First Steps (first lesson completed)
   - On Fire (3-day streak)
   - Foundation Builder (all fundamentals completed)
   - Code Master (all exercises in a lesson completed)
   - Quick Learner (completing a lesson quickly)

3. **Streak Tracking**
   - Tracks consecutive days of learning
   - Visual indicator in the UI
   - Resets if a day is missed

## How to Use These Features

### Adding a Memory Diagram to Lessons

```tsx
<TeachingConcept
  title="Variables Example"
  conceptNumber={1}
  lessonId="your-lesson-id"
  blocks={[
    // ...other blocks
    {
      type: 'memory-diagram',
      caption: 'How variables are stored:',
      interactiveParams: {
        code: `let x = 10;
let name = "John";
let isActive = true;`
      }
    }
  ]}
/>
```

### Tracking Progress in Lessons

Ensure every `TeachingConcept` component has:
1. A unique `conceptNumber`
2. The correct `lessonId`

Example:
```tsx
<TeachingConcept
  title="My Concept"
  subtitle="Description"
  conceptNumber={1}
  lessonId="my-lesson-id"
  blocks={[...]}
/>
```

### Awarding Badges

Add badge awards in the `TeachingConcept` component's `handleComplete` function for special achievements:

```tsx
// Example in TeachingConcept.tsx
if (lessonId === 'variables-intro' && conceptId === '3') {
  giveBadge('quick-learner');
}
```

## Implementation Technical Details

- User progress is stored in `localStorage` using the key `visagent_user_progress`
- Progress is loaded on application start
- The React Context API is used to make progress data available throughout the app
- All interactive components use React hooks for state management
