/**
 * LESSON MODERNIZATION GUIDELINES
 * 
 * This document outlines how to update all lessons with the enhanced UX features.
 * For each lesson, apply the following improvements to make them more interactive and engaging.
 */

/**
 * 1. HIGHLIGHTED KEY TERMS
 * 
 * Identify important technical terms in each lesson and add tooltips.
 * 
 * EXAMPLE:
 * {
 *   type: 'text',
 *   content: 'JavaScript uses variables to store data.',
 *   keyTerms: [
 *     {
 *       term: 'variables',
 *       definition: 'Named storage locations that hold data values in memory.'
 *     }
 *   ]
 * }
 * 
 * COMMON KEY TERMS TO HIGHLIGHT:
 * - variables: Named storage locations in memory that hold data.
 * - functions: Reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks.
 * - arrays: Ordered collections of data that can hold multiple values.
 * - objects: Collections of key-value pairs that represent complex data.
 * - string: A sequence of text characters enclosed in quotes.
 * - number: Numeric data type that can be integer or decimal.
 * - boolean: Logical data type with values true or false.
 * - null: Intentional absence of any object value.
 * - undefined: A variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
 * - console: Browser's debugging interface for outputting messages.
 */

/**
 * 2. VISUALIZATIONS
 * 
 * Add visual metaphors for abstract concepts that help learners understand.
 * Place these after introducing the concept.
 * 
 * EXAMPLE:
 * {
 *   type: 'visualization',
 *   content: 'Visual representation of variables',
 *   visualization: {
 *     type: 'container',
 *     title: 'Variables as Containers',
 *     description: 'Think of variables as labeled boxes that store values.'
 *   }
 * }
 * 
 * VISUALIZATION TYPES AND WHEN TO USE THEM:
 * - container: For variables, values, data storage concepts
 * - flow: For explaining execution order, functions, loops
 * - comparison: For contrasting different concepts (let vs const, null vs undefined)
 * - tree: For showing relationships between concepts
 */

/**
 * 3. PROGRESSIVE DISCLOSURE
 * 
 * Use advanced blocks for detailed information that might overwhelm beginners.
 * 
 * EXAMPLE:
 * {
 *   type: 'advanced',
 *   advancedTitle: 'How Variables Work in Memory',
 *   content: 'Detailed explanation of memory allocation...'
 * }
 * 
 * WHEN TO USE:
 * - Technical details about how things work "under the hood"
 * - Additional edge cases or exceptions
 * - More complex examples beyond the basic concept
 * - Historical context or additional background
 */

/**
 * 4. ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATIONS
 * 
 * Add different ways of explaining difficult concepts for learners who struggle.
 * 
 * EXAMPLE:
 * {
 *   type: 'alternative-explanation',
 *   alternativeTitle: 'If you\'re struggling with variables...',
 *   content: 'Think of variables like name tags on boxes...'
 * }
 * 
 * WHEN TO USE:
 * - For concepts that learners commonly find difficult (closures, this keyword, etc.)
 * - When introducing abstract concepts
 * - To provide real-world analogies for programming concepts
 */

/**
 * 5. RELATED CONCEPTS
 * 
 * Show connections between topics to build a knowledge graph for learners.
 * 
 * EXAMPLE:
 * {
 *   type: 'related-concepts',
 *   content: 'Related topics',
 *   relatedConcepts: [
 *     {
 *       title: 'JavaScript Data Types',
 *       lessonId: 'javascript-data-types',
 *       description: 'Learn what kinds of data can be stored in variables.',
 *       isPrerequisite: false
 *     }
 *   ]
 * }
 * 
 * TYPES OF RELATIONSHIPS:
 * - Prerequisites (what should be learned first)
 * - Follow-up concepts (what to learn next)
 * - Related but separate topics
 */

/**
 * LESSON-SPECIFIC IMPROVEMENTS
 * 
 * IntroToProgrammingLesson:
 * - Add visualizations showing how code gets executed
 * - Highlight terms like "code", "program", "execute"
 * - Related concepts should point to IntroToJavaScript
 * 
 * IntroToJavaScriptLesson:
 * - Add visualization of JavaScript's role in web development
 * - Highlight terms like "interpreter", "syntax", "browser"
 * - Related concepts should point to JavaScript Data Types
 * 
 * JavaScriptDataTypesLesson:
 * - Add visualizations for different data types
 * - Highlight each data type with its definition
 * - Related concepts should point to Variables lesson
 * 
 * VariablesLesson: (Already updated)
 * - Already contains all new UX features
 * 
 * ConsoleLesson:
 * - Add visualization of console messages in browser
 * - Highlight terms like "console.log", "debugging"
 * - Related concepts should point to String Concatenation
 * 
 * StringConcatenationLesson:
 * - Add visualization showing string joining
 * - Highlight terms like "concatenation", "template literals"
 * - Related concepts should link to Variables and Numbers
 * 
 * NumbersLesson:
 * - Add visualization of number types
 * - Highlight terms like "integer", "floating point"
 * - Related concepts should include Math operations
 * 
 * IncrementDecrementLesson:
 * - Add visualization of values changing
 * - Highlight terms like "increment", "decrement", "prefix", "postfix"
 * - Related concepts should link to Numbers and Variables
 * 
 * UndefinedLesson:
 * - Add visualization of undefined vs declared variables
 * - Highlight terms like "declaration", "initialization"
 * - Related concepts should point to Null vs Undefined
 * 
 * NullUndefinedLesson:
 * - Add visualization comparing null and undefined
 * - Highlight terms with precise definitions
 * - Related concepts should include Variable scope
 */

/**
 * IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS
 * 
 * 1. Start with one lesson at a time, beginning with the most fundamental ones
 * 2. For each lesson, identify 3-5 key terms to highlight
 * 3. Add at least one visualization per lesson
 * 4. Add 1-2 advanced sections for deeper explanations
 * 5. Add related concepts at the end of each major section
 * 6. Test the lesson flow to ensure it's not overwhelming
 */

/**
 * CONTENT GUIDELINES
 * 
 * - Keep explanations clear and concise
 * - Use everyday analogies for complex concepts
 * - Ensure definitions are accurate but accessible
 * - Make visualizations intuitive without requiring explanation
 * - Ensure related concepts are truly relevant
